# Contributing

In the spirit of [free software](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html), I encourage **everyone** to help improve this project.
Here are some ways _you_ can contribute:

- Report bugs.
- Suggest new features.
- Write or edit documentation.
- Write specifications.
- Write code (**no patch is too small**: fix typos, add comments, clean up inconsistent whitespace).
- Refactor code.
- Fix [issues](https://github.com/ArielMAJ/Python_API_Challenge/issues).
- Review patches.

## Submitting an issue

This project uses the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ArielMAJ/Python_API_Challenge/issues) to track bugs and features.
Before submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure no one else has already submitted the same bug report.

When submitting a bug report, please include any details that may be necessary to reproduce the bug, including the version of the
API, Python version, and operating system.

## Writing code

Install the development dependencies with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` and always run `black` and `isort` before
committing and making PRs. If youâ€™re adding new functionality, you should provide tests to cover it.
